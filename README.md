# Create machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from data obtained from the Kepler Space Observatory.

## Context
The Kepler Space Observatory is a NASA-build satellite that was launched in 2009. The telescope is dedicated to searching for exoplanets in star systems besides our own, with the ultimate goal of possibly finding other habitable planets besides our own. 

## Data Source

The original dataset is published in [NASA Exoplanet Archive](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/TblView/nph-tblView?app=ExoTbls&config=koi)
The dataset used here is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/kepler-exoplanet-search-results)

## Data
This dataset is a cumulative record of all observed Kepler "objects of interest" — basically, all of the approximately 10,000 exoplanet candidates Kepler has taken observations on.

This dataset has an extensive data dictionary (50 columns). Highlightable columns of note are:
- **kepoi_name:** A KOI is a target identified by the Kepler Project that displays at least one transit-like sequence within Kepler time-series photometry that appears to be of astrophysical origin and initially consistent with a planetary transit hypothesis
- **kepler_name:** [These names] are intended to clearly indicate a class of objects that have been confirmed or validated as planets—a step up from the planet candidate designation.
- **koi_disposition:** The disposition in the literature towards this exoplanet candidate. One of CANDIDATE, FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED or CONFIRMED.
- **koi_pdisposition:** The disposition Kepler data analysis has towards this exoplanet candidate. One of FALSE POSITIVE, NOT DISPOSITIONED, and CANDIDATE.
- **koi_score:** A value between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence in the KOI disposition. For CANDIDATEs, a higher value indicates more confidence in its disposition, while for FALSE POSITIVEs, a higher value indicates less confidence in that disposition.
